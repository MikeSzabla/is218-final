        <h1>Cleaner Code + OOP Terminology</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>Tips and Tricks for Cleaner Code</h3>
        <p>One of the greatest and simplest improvements you as a programmer could make to write cleaner code is to follow a style guide. 
            pylint is a linter used to quality check your python code against the PEP 8 style guide. 
            A linter is an analysis tool that looks at the code itself used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs. 
            PEP 8 is the guideline created for python files that our linter will use.
            Pylint is a powerful tool that understands an often overlooked principle of programming: code is read more often than written. 
            By creating clean code that meets an established level of quality, you can ensure that your code could be easily understood by others, 
            as well as by yourself when it comes time to revisit an old project.</p>

        <p>For this test project, we will be using <code>pip</code> to download the package. Start by entering the command:</p>

        <p><code>pip install pylint</code></p>

        <p>If a Python virtual environment is active, pylint will be installed to that environment. 
            If not, pylint will be installed into the root python installation running on your machine.</p>

        <p>To understand how pylint works, let's first write up a simple script: (You can view the scripts used <a href="https://github.com/MikeSzabla/IS218Project2_examplecode/tree/article1">here</a>)</p>

        <pre><code class="python">
        def print_list(list):
        for item in list:
            print(item)
        ListToPrint = ["I","want","these","printed"]
        print_list(ListToPrint)
        </code>
        </pre>

        <p>example_script_bad.py consists of a method to print lists that are passed into it, and tests the method by creating a list of strings and passing it into the method. 
            Everything in the script is syntactically correct and will run as expected. Let's run this file through pylint using the command:</p>
            
        <p><code>pylint example_script_bad.py</code></p>

        <div id="container">
            <div id="content">
              <p>************* Module example_script_bad<br>
              example_script_bad.py:5:0: C0304: Final newline missing (missing-final-newline)<br>
              example_script_bad.py:1:0: C0114: Missing module docstring (missing-module-docstring)<br>
              example_script_bad.py:1:0: C0116: Missing function or method docstring (missing-function-docstring)<br>
              example_script_bad.py:1:15: W0622: Redefining built-in 'list' (redefined-builtin)<br><br>
              -----------------------------------<br>
              Your code has been rated at 2.00/10</p>
            </div>
        </div><br>

        <p>pylint has given our script a rating of 2.00/10 and outlined various issues. 
            While none of these issues caused any fatal errors, they severely handicap readibility and have the potential to become problematic in the future. 
            With each flagged issue, pylint breaks down (in order) the file it appears in, the line it appears on, and the character it begins at. 
            The description is often enough to fix the issue, however if an unfamiliar flag is raised, 
            you can consult the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP 8 style guide page</a> provided by python.</p>

        <p>Let's fix the code and problamatic code and try again:</p>

        <pre><code class="python">
        """
        ## example_script_good.py ##
        script containing print_list method and a quick test to show its usage.
        """
        
        
        def print_list(input_list):
            """print_list: takes in a list as a parameter and prints each element out on a new line.
        
            input_list: list of elements
            """
            for item in input_list:
                print(item)
        
        
        list_to_print = ["I", "want", "these", "printed"]
        print_list(list_to_print)
        
        </code>
        </pre>

        <p>After fixing all of the issues brought up by pylint, saving the file to a new script <code>example_script_good.py</code> and re-running pylint gives the result:</p>

        <div id="container">
            <div id="content">
              <p>$ pylint example_script_good.py<br><br>

                ------------------------------------<br>
                Your code has been rated at 10.00/10</p>
            </div>
        </div><br>

        <p>Even though our script has not changed at all in functionality, it now follows the strict PEP 8 standards. This makes our script much more readable, 
            and ensures that other developers (who should also be following these guidelines) 
            will have a much easier time understand the purpose of your code and exactly how it functions.
        </p><br>

        <p><code>Object</code>- "bundle" consisting of a set of variables which define the states the object can exist in and a set of functions that define the behavior of that object</p>
        <p><code>Static Variable</code>- a member variable of a given class which is shared across all instances, and is accessible as a member variable of these objects</p>
        <p><code>Type Cast</code>- a method of changing an entity from one data type to another</p>
        <p><code>Type Hint</code>- hint provided to functions telling it to only accept the given data type</p>
