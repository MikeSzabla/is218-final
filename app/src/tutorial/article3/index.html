        <h1>Principles of Object Oriented Programming</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
        <p>Encapsulation describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This is done with the purpose of protecting data from being 
            changed accidentally. The best example of encapsulation in an object-oriented program is a class. A class allows you to create instances of an object that hold 
            it's own data values and methods to manipulate said data. These bits of data could be made private or protected to ensure that they are not touched in the event 
            of a child class that's derived from it. An example of this within the calculator application would be the classes created for each operation: 
            (full scripts viewable <a href="https://github.com/MikeSzabla/IS218Project2_examplecode/tree/article3">here</a>)
        </p>

        <pre><code class="python">
            class Addition(Calculation):  # pylint: disable=too-few-public-methods
                """Addition Class"""
        
                def get_result(self):   # addition-specific method encapsulated within Addition class
                    """returns all passed values added together"""
                    result = self.values[0]
                    for value in self.values[1:]:
                        result += value
                    return result
        </code>
        </pre>

        <p>Here, we are encapsulatin get_result method within the Addition class. The get_result function performs a function specific to the Addition class, 
            which is why it's valuable to keep it within these bounds.
        </p>

        <h3>Inheritance</h3>

        <p>Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. This allows programmers to structure their objects in a 
            more realistic manner which follows how people attribute characteristics first on a broad level, then getting more detailed as the focus becomes more narrow. 
            It also gives programmers an opportunity to not repeat themselves; another important principle. For example, our calculator supports many calculations. 
            However, there are some aspects of each calculation that remain constant, such as the existence of values that will be used within the operations.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="python">
            # Division class inheriting from parent class Calculation
            class Division(Calculation):  # pylint: disable=too-few-public-methods
                """Division Class"""
            
                def get_result(self):
                    """returns value_a divided by value_b"""
                    result = self.values[0]
                    for value in self.values[1:]:
                        result = result / value
                    return result
        </code>
        </pre>
            
        <p>Just like the rest of the calculations, the Division class inherits from Calcuation access to values which were set when the Calculation was first instantiated.</p>

        <h3>Polymorphism</h3>

        <p>Polymorphism is the use of the same function for different uses. This could mean handling a variable amount of variables, or handing different variable types 
            without creating a separate method or function. Polymorphism is extremely useful in statically-typed languages like Java, allowing you to create generic functions 
            that can work with multiple different data types. This both the developer time, decreases program complexity, and creates cleaner code.</p>

        <p>Since python is a dynamically-typed language, we don't have to worry about the data types of our parameters. However, our calculator could benefit greatly from 
            accepting a variable amount of arguments when performing operations. Here are snippets of code demonstrating this taken from <a href="https://github.com/MikeSzabla/IS218Project2_examplecode/tree/article3b">this version</a> 
            of the calculator which has been adjusted to support variable arguments in its calculations instead of tuples:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="python">
            def test_addition():
                """method calling Addition operation"""
                # Arrange
                addition = Addition.create(1, 2, 3)  # creating an addition object using 3 parameters to add
                # Act
                result = addition.get_result()
                # Assert
                assert result == 6
            
                # Arrange
                addition2 = Addition.create(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  # creating an addition object using 5 parameters to add
                # Act
                result = addition2.get_result()
                # Assert
                assert result == 15
        </code>
        </pre>

        <p>Here is a test for the addition operation that accepts a variable amount of parameters. Python allows this because of the <code>*args</code> argument we implemented in our 
            <code>Calculation.create()</code> method:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="python">
            class Calculation:  # pylint: disable=too-few-public-methods
                """Calculation Class"""
                def __init__(self, *args):
                    """constructor setting variable amount of args into values tuple stored within the calculation"""
                    self.values = args
        
                @classmethod
                def create(cls, *args):
                    """class method create"""
                    return cls(*args)
        </code>
        </pre>

        <h3>Abstraction</h3>

        <p>Abstraction is used to hide background details or any unnecessary implementation. In OOP, this often takes the form of abstract classes, which are classes that contain 
            all of the different method declarations the class will need, but none of the content within those methods. This creates a blueprint for children to follow when 
            inheriting from the abstract parent. In the calculator application, there is no explicit use of an abstract class, however the Calculation method does have 
            a single abstract method:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="python">
            class Calculation(ABC):  # pylint: disable=too-few-public-methods
                """Calculation Class"""
                def __init__(self, args: tuple):
                    """default constructor setting up value variables"""
                    self.values = Calculation.args_to_float_tuple(args)

                @abstractmethod
                # abstract get_result method that must be implemented by every child
                def get_result(self):
                    pass
        </code>
        </pre>

        <p>Because of this abstract get_result method, all calculations that inherit from Calculation must implement a get_result method.</p>
