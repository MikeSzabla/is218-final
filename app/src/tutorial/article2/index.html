        <h1>AAA Testing</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>How to Test Your Methods</h3>
        <p>A common issue most programmers face is making changes to methods or functions and later finding out those changes has unexpected consequences. 
            Especially when projects begin to grow, it's important to set up your program to catch mistakes before they can make a mess. Here is where AAA testing comes in.</p>

        <p>AAA stands for "Arrange, Act, Assert".</p>
        
        <p>To arrage means to set up the conditions for a test, i.e. if you're testing a method that checks the length of a list, here is where you would create a list.<br>
            To act means to perform the action you plan on testing. Using the list length example, here we would call the length method.<br>
            To assert means to check if our act did what we expected. In python, we will be using the <code>assert</code> keyword to evaulate a boolean expression which checks 
            to see if our act was successful. For our length example, this could be done by asserting that our list length is what we expect it to be.
        </p>

        <p>Let's look at a code snippet from the Calculator add to see how AAA testing works: (You can view the scripts used <a href="https://github.com/MikeSzabla/IS218Project2_examplecode/tree/article2">here</a>)</p>

        <pre><code class="python">
            def test_calculator_add_static():
                """Testing the add function of the calculator"""
                NewCalculator = Calculator()    # arrange
                NewCalculator.add_number((1, 1))   # act
                last_operation = NewCalculator.get_last_operation()
                assert isinstance(last_operation, Addition) # assert
            </code>
            </pre>

        <p>In this test method, I am testing the effectiveness of the addition method by checking if the addition I performed in the act was added to the calculator's history. 
        I'm not checking to see the result of the addition, since there is a separate test for the addition so check if it works arithmetically. 
        This is a simple, hard-coded test that will perform similarly in all situations. However, there exist situations where it's useful to supply a large amount of test cases 
        to see how the methods will perform under different conditions.</p>

        <p>Testing your code with a systematic method like this is important because as your project grow in scale and more elements become more reliant on each other, 
            it becomes very easy to make a change that seems like a bug fix but unintentionally breaks something far from where you made your change. Unit testing provides 
            a safe and deterministic way to ensure any changes you make to your code won't affect other parts of your program.
        </p>
            
        <p>Hard-coding tests for methods like that is difficult and not scalable. The solution to this is using external data files filled with the test case values. 
        These files can then be read in and passed into the test methods iteratively. This process allows for large amounts of test cases to be created efficiently 
        and without cluttering the program.</p>

        <p>Using the pandas library, we can read in a csv file filled with test case values straight into our test function. Here's the addition method being tested with this method: </p>

        <div id="container">
            <div id="content">
              <p>addition_test_small.csv<br><br>
                value a,value b,answer<br>
                3642,1563,5205<br>
                672,5541,6213<br>
                497,4772,5269<br>
                8326,1643,9969<br>
                2066,4942,7008<br>
                7794,127,7921<br>
                6883,9000,15883<br>
                3808,789,4597<br>
                6106,4453,10559<br>
                6285,7036,13321</p>
            </div>
        </div><br>

        <pre><code class="python">
        def test_addition():
            """method calling Addition operation"""
            dataframe = pd.read_csv(data_path)
            for index, row in dataframe.iterrows():
                # Arrange & Act
                addition = Addition.create((row['value a'], row['value b']))
                result = addition.get_result()
                # Assert
                assert result == float(row['answer'])
        </code>
        </pre>

        <p>Note that with this test, the arrange and act are done in the same step because the actual addition happens as the addition object is being constructed.</p>
